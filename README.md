# Countdown_timer
the code provided takes an input in seconds and then counts down from that time, displaying the remaining time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It then prints "times up" when the countdown reaches 0.

Here's how the code works:

1. It imports the `time` module to use the `time.sleep` function for a one-second delay.
2. It takes an input from the user, which is assumed to be the duration in seconds.
3. It enters a loop that counts down from the input time to 0.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates and prints the remaining time in the format "hh:mm:ss".
5. It uses `time.sleep(1)` to pause the program for one second between each iteration of the loop.
6. When the loop finishes (i.e., when the countdown reaches 0), it prints "times up."

The code appears to work as intended for counting down time in hours, minutes, and seconds, with leading zeros for single-digit values. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code, please feel free to ask.
